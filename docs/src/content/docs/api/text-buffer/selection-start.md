title: selectionStart
description: The left edge of a buffer's selection, whichever way it was made.
---

Get the left edge of the selection: the smaller of `anchor` and `head`.

```ts
import { selectionStart } from "text-buffer";
```

```ts
selectionStart(buffer);
```

## Example

```ts
import { createTextBuffer, selectionStart } from "text-buffer";

selectionStart(createTextBuffer("hello", { anchor: 1, head: 4 })); // → 1
selectionStart(createTextBuffer("hello", { anchor: 4, head: 1 })); // → 1
```

## Parameters

| Name     | What it is             |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| `buffer` | The buffer to look at. |

## Returns

A position in the text. For a forward selection it is `anchor`, for a
backward selection it is `head`, and for a plain cursor it is the cursor
position.

## Why you need it

`anchor` and `head` tell you how the user selected. To work with the selected
text itself, you usually want the left and right edges instead, the same as
the DOM's `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd`:

```ts
const text = buffer.text.slice(selectionStart(buffer), selectionEnd(buffer));
```
