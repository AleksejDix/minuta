A component that renders the row of weekday names ("Mon", "Tue", …) above the
calendar grid, in the week order of the units.

```js
import { CalendarWeekdays } from "minuta-vue/components";
```

```vue
<CalendarWeekdays locale="en-US" />
```

## Example

You rarely render it yourself: [`CalendarGrid`](../calendar-grid/) already
includes it and passes its own `locale`.

```vue
<script setup>
import { CalendarGrid, CalendarRoot } from "minuta-vue/components";
import { nativeUnits } from "minuta/native";

const sundayFirst = nativeUnits({ weekStartsOn: "sunday" });
</script>

<template>
  <CalendarRoot :units="sundayFirst">
    <CalendarGrid locale="de-CH" />
  </CalendarRoot>
</template>
```

The header row reads "So Mo Di Mi Do Fr Sa": German short names, starting on
Sunday because the units say so.

## Props

| Name     | What it is                         | Default   |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| `locale` | The language of the weekday names. | `"en-US"` |

It has no slots and emits no events.

## What it renders

A table head, so it belongs inside a `<table>`:

```html
<thead class="calendar-weekdays" data-testid="calendar-weekdays">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col" abbr="Monday">Mon</th>
    …
  </tr>
</thead>
```

Each header shows the short name and carries the full name in `abbr`, which
screen readers read out. Names use the time zone of the units
(`units.timeZone`). With `minuta-vue/style.css`, the names are small, grey
and uppercase.

## Errors

Outside a [`CalendarRoot`](../calendar-root/) — even inside a plain
`MinutaRoot` — it throws `Calendar parts must be used within <CalendarRoot>`.
